        <div id="What is a hedgehog?">
            <h3>1. What is a hedgehog?</h3>
            <p>Hedgehogs are small, spiny mammals that first evolved about 
            <em>15 million years ago</em>. They are about the size of a adult human 
            hand and carry pointy keratin spikes on their backs. There is a 
            common misconception that Hedgehogs and Porcupines are the same 
            creature but there is a large size difference and a porcupine's 
            quills are much larger.  Hedgehogs often curl into a ball when 
            feeling threatened and hope that predators will leave them alone 
            or damage themselves on its quills.  Overall Hedgehogs are very 
            peculiar creatures but there is a lot of different features that 
            make them awsome.<a href="https://www.hedgehogstreet.org/about-hedgehogs/hedgehogs-history/#:~:text=Hedgehogs%20are%20small%2C%20spiny%20mammals,East%2C%20Africa%20and%20Central%20Asia."><em>Learn More here</em></a></p>

        <div id="Hedgehogs Diet">
            <h3>2. Hedgehogs Diet</h3>
            <p>Hedgehogs often eat whatever bugs they can scavenge on the forest floor. </p>
            <p>This can <b>include:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Worms</li>
                <li>Centipedes</li>
                <li>Snails</li>
                <li>Caterpillars</li>
                <li>Earwigs</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="Anointing">
            <h3>3. Anointing</h3>
            <p>On the topic of food hedgehogs are considered to be <b>self-anointing</b> 
            animals. When a hedgehog anoints they foam at the mouth and use their 
            tongue to spread the foam all over their body. Many people may believe 
            that this is abnormal behaviour but it is completely natural. In the 
            wild Hedgehogs are very careful of their scents and try to blend in as 
            much as possible to be able to avoid predators so spreading the scent 
            or a bug or another thing on them will help them <b>blend in</b> more with the 
            smells that surround them.</p>
            <p>The video below demonstrates a hedgehog anointing:</p>

        <div id="Why are Hedgehogs Nocturnal?">
            <h3>4. Why are Hedgehogs Nocturnal?</h3>
            <p>When an animal is nocturnal it means that they are <b>active during the 
            night and sleeping through the day</b>. Most animals have their specific 
            reason for this habit but it is mostly for the sake of survival. Hedgehogs 
            do this because they have less competition to get food during the night 
            time.  Hedgehogs have poor eyesight especially when it is light out so they 
            make up for it with their amazing hearing and sense of smell.  With their 
            heightened senses they are able to detect if there is other animals around 
            them and use the quills to help.</p>
            <p>Overall Hedgehogs are often not awake during the day but there can be an 
            exception to this when a pregnant female is gathering nesting materials 
            before she gives birth or when she is gathering food and water for her young 
            while they sleep during the day.  Another exception is when a hedgehog is in 
            danger or does not feel safe enough to sleep during the night. </p>

            <h3>5. The Life Cycle of a Wild Hedgehog</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="hoglets">
            <h4>Hoglets</h4>
            <p>This is the first stage of a Hedgehogs life because it is the first couple 
            weeks that they are alive.  In these weeks they are with their mother who feeds 
            them and makes sure that they are healthy. After these weeks the mother usually 
            abandons them and leaves them to survive on their own. Occasionally a mother may 
            stay in her nest and expect the hoglets to leave but if the mother senses danger 
            at anytime she may eat her own babies. Scientists believe that mother hedgehogs 
            may do this because they fear for the safety and thinks that it is better for her 
            to have all of the nutrients of her young that a predator having it.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Adulthood</h4>
            <p>This is the majority of a hedgehogs life as they find ways to get food and try 
            to survive in the wild. Hedgehogs do hibernate in the winter so they spend their 
            entire summers eating food and then rest. Since hedgehogs usually live in warmer 
            climates it is important for them to not go through harsh winters as they do not 
            have a ton of fur on them.</p>

            <h4>Death</h4>
            <p>Alike to every other living thing on earth, hedgehogs die.  Often the life 
            expectancy of a hedgehog is <b>3-4 years</b> but it can depend on the type of environment 
            that they live in and if they catch any diseases. </p>
            <p>Examples of diseases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye Problems</li>
                <li>Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome</li>
                <li>Cancer</li>
                <li>Tooth Pathology</li>
                <li>Heart Disease</li>
                <li>Ringworms</li>

            <h3>6. Hedgehogs as Pets</h3>
            <p>Hedgehogs have become a common pet for families to have.  Since hedgehogs are 
            quiet and low-maintenance animals they can often fit well into a household. When 
            comfortable, hedgehogs are social creatures that enjoy being held and adventuring 
            different areas.</p>
            <p>If you are wanting to have a pet hedgehogs there are some things 
            to consider before getting one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are nocturnal and will be active at night so if its cage is in your 
                bedroom are you fine with the noise?</li>
                <li>Are you able to provide it with a large enough cage which contains food, 
                water, shelter, toys, a running wheel and more?</li>
                <li>Will you be willing to bathe and clip the nail of the hedgehog because 
                they will not be able to naturally keep their nails short?</li>
                <li>They are social but also like their space so will you be willing to provide 
                them a quiet space during the day while they sleep?</li>
                <li>Are there other animals in the household which may scare the hedgehog or 
                make it uncomfortable?</li>
                <li>If you plan to take a vacation or go away for a couple days will you have 
                someone who is able to look after the hedgehog?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is a lot of questions that you may ask yourself before getting a hedgehog 
            but overall they are very lovely creatures to take care and there are many fun things 
            to do with your spikey pet.</p>
